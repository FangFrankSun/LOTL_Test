In this Final Essay of your Genesis cycle, this assignment will be both an Atlas of benchmarks and tentative Almanac of optimistic constructive steps of resilience along the way, found in the density of the final image “Desolation” of Cole’s Course of Empire. How is The Next Nature of the Lawn to be envisioned? How do we construct Grounds of eschatological resilience for an Arcadian nation where Architecture serves as an ethical catalyst for being well with the world immediately for both of Niebuhr’s Children of Light and Darkness? Infuse then Lippmann’s “America as Barren Ground” in A Preface to Morals, Saroyan’s The Human Comedy, Alice Walker’s In Search of My Mother’s Garden, Brodsky’s Watermark and McClung’s’ The Architecture of Paradise in this six-part heuristic narrative.
