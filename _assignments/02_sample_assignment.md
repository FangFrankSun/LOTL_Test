In the clear light of day, we, as Caravaggio’s Narcissus, can distinguish first the thickened edge of pervasive amniotic Water and regenerative Land. Imagine the step by step process of the construction of the Academical Village from materials at hand: clay, wood, water, fire, lime, slate, stone, sand and the magic of glass and metals by a collaborative, not heroic, work force of citizens and strangers distinguished as Surveyors, Nomads and Lunatics. These first steps are often hidden by processes of extraction and transformation and have nothing to do with the final compositional shape. What instruments are used to meter and then to make? Who are the agents referenced in Carol Burns’ Site Constructions, Henry David Thoreau’s Walden Pond and Spencer Haynsworth Woodcock’s An Inventory of Site Constructions?
