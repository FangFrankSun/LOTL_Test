After the world co-evolved over Geological time, Adam emerged from the fecundities of the depths of the red clay of Eden to take on the Dominion of the inherited bounty of Paradise, even then conceived as a walled-in garden. Succumbed by the hubris of knowledge, the Serpent guides the construction of Adam’s House in Paradise, some recall now locally in Monticello and more pretentiously in Parcel X, more distantly in Villa Savoye, Falling Water, Villa Mairea, and condensed in Venturi’s Mother’s house. Monticello, as dwelling in Arcadia, was a flawed spatial and political model of a community, and is then the subsequent theater of the Academical Village equally flawed as a model of Raphael’s more inclusive School of Athens. Advanced this creation story journeyed from your Day 1 Satiric setting, to Serlio’s final resultant urban theaters of Comedy and Tragedy which haunt the Lawn today.
(Joseph Rykwert, Joseph Campbell, & William Curtis).
