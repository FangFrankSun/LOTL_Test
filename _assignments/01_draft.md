In the Beginning, for the incipient, primal, some call archaic human imagination encoded in Genesis, the world was first perceived, then conceived in chaos, a condition of overwhelming variables known to some as a morass, or brownfield, until the human imagination assigned the frictional fiction of Recurrent Dualities. In this heart of darkness, there was the aspiration for light. The unknown is the seething compost of the Night, to which is drawn the Sun and then the Moon in accountable, rotational order. Naipaul in his excerpt from The Enigma of Arrival awakens after forty days of rain and darkness. Sontag takes us in The Volcano Lover to the chaos of a Sunday flea market in Pompeii. Find in addition two distinct “seeds of thought “, such as a pistachio and chili pepper, to be in dialogue with these two essential questions: From where do you come from? and where do you now find yourselves? Write no more than one page on the self-conscious beginning of a Creation Story of lessons derived from your initial readings of the Academical Village inspired by Naipaul and Sontag, your self-selected seeds for thought and your origins and locus of regenerative oases which we will call The Grounds.
