Within this encampment of flora and fauna, plants and animals in natural co-existence,
harmony exists in these evolutionary Dragons of Eden (Carl Sagan) where Solnit and Berger narrate a world before the human imagination, a stage of agricultural and pastoral settings, of nature conceived as Wildness and then transformed as pragmatic Landscape, before the human mind introduced the idea of the Garden, a walled-off place, focused on the diurnal and nocturnal skies. Refer to the similarly scaled primal precinct of the Acropolis and the Salk Center, the Campidoglio and Chandigarh as surrogate theaters for the Academical Village echoed perhaps in La Villette, Bilbao, and/or the Getty Center.
