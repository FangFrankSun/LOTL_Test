Upon these foundational fluidities of hidden figures and stabilizing accountable geometries, assign specifications for construction to endure over a lunar cycle from new moon to full moon and back, the erection of cave-like walls first and tent-like frames second, the generation of the Forest Edge (Geddes) revisited in the Colonnades and in the paired regenerative columns in the dome room, and read in the Easy Pieces of doors and windows, then basements first to support the celestial soffits of the Attics above, onto metered hearths and dynamic landscapes of an expansive Lawn and productive gardens paying homage in the end to blind Homer and his adolescent guide who watch over you , as the seventh generation is obligated to interrogate the responsibilities of a collaborative citizenship. (Solnit’s Field Guide, Berger’s Shape of a Pocket, & Defoe’s Robinson Crusoe)
